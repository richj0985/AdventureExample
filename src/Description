We will create an "adventure" game using the screens 
from the original Legend of Zelda. The folder zelda has 
all of these screens broken up for you as gif images.
These images are named Tile_RX_CYY, where the X is
replaced by the row of the image, and Y is the column, with
(0,0) being the top left hand corner of the map. There is
a text file called titles.txt that describes what directions
you are allowed to move when you are on a specific screen.
A line in the textfile is as follows:
Tile_R8_C8 TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE
and follows the format
tile_name go_north go_east go_south go_west

Using this information, create a GUI that can navigate
the world of Hyrule using 4 buttons to move North,
South, East, and West.
